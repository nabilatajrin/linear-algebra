### Gram-Schmidt-process
The Gram-Schmidt process is a method for constructing an orthonormal  basis of a space that a set of given vectors span. It can also be used  to determine the dimension of that space, which may be different than  the dimension of the vectors themselves or the number of vectors provided to span the space.

This is a program that computes a  Gram-Schmidt basis, and gives the dimension of a span of vectors.

### reflecting-bear
In this assessment, we will use the knowledge of changing basis to construct a matrix that performs a transformation that is easy in a particular basis, but complicated in our starting basis. Namely we shall help Panda Bear determine what his reflection will look like in a mirror that he has placed at an angle.

### PageRank
In this notebook, we'll build on our knowledge of eigenvectors and eigenvalues by exploring the PageRank algorithm.
The notebook is in two parts, the first is a worksheet to get us up to speed with how the algorithm works - here we will look at a micro-internet with fewer than 10 websites and see what it does and what can go wrong.
The second is an assessment which will test our application of eigentheory to this problem by writing code and calculating the page rank of a large network representing a sub-section of the internet.
